#' Documenting the FizzBuzz function
#'
#' The goal is to count as high as you can, but for
#' any number evenly divisible by 3, substitute “Fizz”
#' and any number evenly divisible by 5, substitute
#' “Buzz,” and if it is divisible by both, substitute
#' “Fizz Buzz.”
#' So the sequence will look like 1, 2, Fizz, 4,
#' Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, ...
#'
#' @param runtime is a real integer
#' @return a list of the following: a number, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', or 'FizzBuzz'
#' @examples
#' FizzBuzz(20)
#' FizzBuzz(20:50)
